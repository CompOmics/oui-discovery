There was a problem with the headers of the OpenProt database. This has been fixed, but I had to rerun the openprot search. 
The fix = rewriting the header in the ">op|{uniacc}|{uniacc} ..."
It was ">op|{uniacc}|{taxon} ..." and ionbot interpreted the taxon (the word immediately after "|") as the protein entry during parsing.
All information is still present in the header, I only wrote the uniprot accession twice.

Minor issue with the "spectrum titles" in PXD014258.
Some mgf files (converted with old ThermoRawPerser version??) include the filename in the spectrum title. 
The ones I converted myself do not.

Calculated group-wise FDR and shared with Valeriia.
I also renamed a few files: the original "combined-filtered-results" files are now just "combined-results"
(the "filtered" tag was a leftover from an old script)

Big change in the classification of peptides.
First I was using the "leading protein", now I take into account ALL proteins.
A peptide is 'Contam' if it maps to at least 1 contaminant.
A peptide is 'Canon' if it maps to at least 1 canonical protein (Uniprot) and no contaminants.
A peptide is 'NonCanon' if it maps to no canonical proteins and no contaminants.

2024/12/13 -- IMPORTANT!
Up to now, I have been working with PSM-level qvalue only!
The ionbot.first.peptides table is non-redundant and only reports the highest score for each peptide IGNORING MODIFCATIONS
